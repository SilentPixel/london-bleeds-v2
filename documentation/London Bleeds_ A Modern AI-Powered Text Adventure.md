# London Bleeds: A Modern AI-Powered Text Adventure

##  1\. Executive Summary

This document outlines the concept for "London Bleeds," a text adventure game set in Victorian London during the Jack the Ripper murders. The player assumes the role of Dr. Watson, the trusted companion to Sherlock Holmes. This is a lost adventure by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle about the famous detective Sherlock Holmes. The game aims to modernize the classic text adventure genre using AI for intuitive interaction and dynamic storytelling. This document serves as a foundational guide for design and development, incorporating user context regarding existing GUI, AI story generation, and the need for a re-engineered game engine.

## 2\. Game Concept & Vision

* **Game Name:** London Bleeds  
* **Genre:** AI-Powered Text Adventure, Detective Mystery  
* **Setting:** Victorian London, 1888 at the height of the Jack the Ripper murders.  
* **Core Gameplay Loop:** Investigate crime scenes, interact with characters, gather clues, solve puzzles, and make decisions that influence the outcome of the Jack the Ripper case and the protagonist's personal narrative.  
* **Inspiration:** Writings of Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes adventures, classic text adventures like Zork and Infocom.  
* **Key Innovation:** Seamless, natural language interaction powered by AI, eliminating rigid command structures.  
* **Key Innovation:** A more immersive world where the user can explore the environment and getting responses generated by AI instead of every scenario has to be part of the story ‘screenplay’.

## 3\. Story & Narrative

The overarching story, characters, clues, and locations form the foundation of the game, with AI enabling dynamic exploration within the defined narrative boundaries. The story, characters, clues, objects, mysteries etc will be defined in the game engine, but the AI will enhance the games understanding of player input and also the player would be able to examine and investigate the world better than the old adventure games could. We will try and avoid repeat messages like ‘I dont know that command’ or ‘I see a wall but nothing special about it.’ This is where the AI would kick in and give a reasonable response like as an example ‘I see a wall and the stonework is quite remarkable’.

## 4\. Game Mechanics

The game mechanics should be similar to classic text adventures but enhanced by AI for a more immersive and intuitive experience.

The locations, items, characters, mysteries, clues, atmospheric effects will be provided and stored in the game story engine. The AI will handle the players request to the best of its ability. Example: The player is in a dark alley and see a police man. 

* **Player Actions:**  
  * **Look Around/Observe:** Player can describe their surroundings. AI generates a rich, contextual description of the current location. This should be dynamic and not pre-written, allowing for nuanced responses based on player input.  
  * **Examine:** Players can examine specific objects, clues, or individuals. AI provides detailed, context-aware responses. This should include dynamic descriptions, not just predefined object properties.  
  * **Talk To/Converse:** Players can engage in natural language conversations with characters. AI should facilitate open-ended dialogue, interpreting player intent and responding in character, potentially revealing clues or advancing relationships.  
  * **Move/Navigate:** Players can visit various locations within the Whitechapel area. AI should handle navigation commands organically (e.g., "Go to the pub," "Head to Scotland Yard").  
  * **Use/Interact:** Player can interact with objects in a meaningful way (e.g., "Use the key on the lock," "Light the lamp"). AI interprets the intent and executes the action or provides a relevant response.  
  * **Inventory Management (Implied):** While not explicitly stated, players will likely acquire items. The game should allow players to implicitly or explicitly manage these. The AI can assist with this (e.g., "What's in my pockets?").  
* **Progression System:**  
  * **Clue Gathering:** Progress is primarily driven by discovering and interpreting clues.  
  * **Decision-Making:** Player choices should have consequences, influencing character relationships, available paths, and ultimately, the game's ending.  
  * **Risk/Reward:** The player can encounter danger and "die" if incorrect commands or choices are made. This should be a direct consequence of AI interpretation and narrative flow.  
* **Dynamic Events:**  
  * **Random Atmospheric Events:** Implement AI-driven random events (e.g., a sudden downpour, a street vendor's cry, distant shouts) to enhance atmosphere and unpredictability without necessarily affecting the plot directly.  
  * **Time Progression (Optional but Recommended):** Consider a subtle in-game time system that influences events, character availability, or environmental descriptions, adding another layer of realism.  
* **Save/Load Functionality:**  
  * Players can save and load their progress via simple commands (e.g., "Save game," "Load game").

## 5\. Game Engine

Given the existing issues with the current engine, a complete rewrite is necessary, focusing on modularity, scalability, and robust AI integration.

### 5.1. Core Technologies

* **Frontend Framework:** React or Vue. This provides a modern, responsive UI.  
* **Backend Logic Engine:** Python is highly suitable for its readability, extensive libraries, and strong support for AI/ML integrations. Other suitable languages could be Node.js (for full-stack JavaScript) or Go (for performance).  
* **AI Integration:** OpenAI API will be used for all AI-generated content and interpretations.  
* **Database integration:** To ensure robust data management, consistency, and efficient retrieval of game elements, the following database integration strategies will be employed:  
* **Primary Database:** SQLite will be used for storing core game data due to its lightweight nature and ease of integration.  
* **Vector Database for AI Memory (FAISS):** FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) will be integrated to provide a vector memory for the AI. This allows the AI to reliably recall and repeat facts, names, places, and established game rules, ensuring consistency in AI-generated responses.  
* **Separation of Seed Data and AI-Generated Content:** A clear distinction will be maintained between pre-defined "seed" content (e.g., core narrative, characters, locations) and AI-generated proposals. AI-generated narrative elements or modifications will require explicit approval before becoming canonical within the game.  
* **Memory:** It is vital that AI responses are connected to the setting the player is in. The AI would need to ‘know’ where the reader is in the gameworld to give good answers. The AI responses should also be added to the database and stored so that it can be referenced later if the player encounters a character or examines an object that has been previously talked to or examined. There should be a memory of the AI responses. Example: If players are examining a character that is investigating,  smokes, sitting in a chair etc the AI needs to take this into consideration if the player is interacting with this character. If an object description says its damaged the AI response should take this into consideration when creating a response.    
* **Memory:** AI responses must be relevant to the player's current location within the game world. The AI should maintain a memory of previous interactions, storing responses in a database. This allows for consistent referencing if players re-encounter characters or objects previously discussed or examined. For example, if a player interacts with a character described as investigating, smoking, or sitting in a chair, the AI should incorporate these details into its response. Similarly, if an object is described as damaged, the AI's response should reflect this condition.  
* **Fact Indexing:** Key facts, lore, and established game parameters will be indexed within the vector memory to enable the AI to consistently reference and adhere to the game's established world.  
* **Lore Immutability:** Critical lore elements, such as specific locations or Non-Player Characters (NPCs), will be marked as immutable by default. Any modifications to these elements will require explicit unlocking and approval, preventing unintended alterations by the AI.  
* **Version Control:** All game data, including text and narrative elements, will be versioned. This enables easy rollbacks to previous states, facilitates A/B testing of narrative variations, and supports analytics on player progression and choices.

### 5.2. AI Response Persona & Consistency

* **Authorial Voice:** The server's AI responses *must* mimic the writing style of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, demonstrating expertise in crafting short, elegant sentences evocative of 1888 London. This requires careful prompt engineering for the OpenAI API.  
* **AI Dependency:** The game is critically dependent on the AI API. If the AI or API is unavailable, the game *will not run*. There is no backup solution, emphasizing the AI's central role.

### 5.3. Input Interpretation & Responsiveness

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The engine must interpret natural language commands without requiring rigid keywords like "get" or "take" (e.g., "Please take the key from the drawer," "Could you examine the lamp?").
