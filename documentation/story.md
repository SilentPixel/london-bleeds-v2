# London Bleeds: The Whitechapel Diaries

## Story Overview

### A High-Level Summary of the Story

Set in the bleak winter of 1888–1889, amid the aftershocks of the Whitechapel murders, "London Bleeds: The Whitechapel Diaries" follows Dr. John H. Watson as he uncovers a blood-dyed journal whose shifting prose seems to predict crimes yet uncommitted. Sherlock Holmes, drawn to the case with unnerving fervour, suspects a human agency masked by superstition; the diary hints at a clandestine fraternity—the Thirteen—whose rites repurpose the city’s corpses for a darker calculus. As reason wrestles with nightmare, Watson must decide whether the horror is occult theatre or an elaborate smokescreen for a killer who understands the mind as precisely as the knife.

### Main Mystery and Setting

- **Main Mystery:** Who authored the Whitechapel Diary, and how do its entries map to both the canonical Ripper crimes and a fresh series of copycat atrocities? Is the so‑called fraternity real, or a delusion engineered to cloud the truth?
- **Setting:** Gaslit London—Whitechapel alleys, morgues and workhouses, clandestine parlours, and the cool refuge of 221B—where soot and fog turn lampglow into drowned stars.

### Key Themes and Atmosphere

- **Reason vs. Delirium:** Deduction strained by visions and unreliable texts.
- **Public Facade vs. Private Rot:** Charitable institutions masking cruelty; respectable gentlemen with ruinous appetites.
- **Obsession and Complicity:** How far Holmes and Watson will go for the truth—and what stains remain.
- **Text as Curse:** A book that reads its reader; evidence that demands belief.

## Chapters & Opening Scene

### Chapter One — *The Diary of Blood* (Playable Prologue)

**Opening Beat: The Room Above the Den**  
- *Objective:* Reorient as Watson; retrieve revolver, medical bag, Holmes’s urgent note.  
- *Atmosphere:* Sooty lamplight, distant river-horn, sickroom heat.  
- *Interactive:* Examine cracked mirror (brief hallucination prompt); optional laudanum vial (affects later sanity checks).

**Inciting Discovery: The Book**  
- *Find:* Blood-flecked diary beneath a moth-eaten blanket.  
- *Mechanic:* Flip through 3–4 unstable pages; words “crawl,” then settle into legible verse matching details only the killer should know.  
- *Clue Unlocked:* *Entry VII: The Bride of the Morning Fire* → imagery matching Mary Jane Kelly’s crime scene; a marginal sigil (later matched at a second site).

**Interruption: The Knock**  
- *NPC:* Finch, a street urchin (barefoot, chilblains), delivers Holmes’s note: “Bring what you have found. Come at once.”  
- *Optional Search:* Scrap from *Pall Mall Gazette*, broken silver locket (a woman’s portrait), syringe with murky residue.  
- *Choice:* Confront Elias Pike (den‑keeper) now or depart; confronting yields a terse warning: “Books bite, doctor.”

**Transition: Into the Fog**  
- *Traversal:* Whitechapel to Baker Street; ambient whispers, police whistles, a butcher’s cart with dark stains.  
- *Stinger:* As Watson crosses Commercial Street, the diary warms in his pocket; a single line appears unbidden: “*The doctor will write the rest.*”

**Chapter Goal:** Place the diary before Holmes; decide whether to confess the brief hallucination.  
**Fail State (Soft):** If Watson doses with laudanum twice, a phantom overlay distorts two subsequent scenes (unreliable descriptions; insight roll available to correct).

## Mystery Elements

### Main Mystery
- Identity of the diary’s author and the organising hand behind the murders and mimicries.

### Sub‑Mysteries
- Why do diary lines appear to change in Watson’s presence?  
- Who funds the midnight “alms” and to what end?  
- What became of Holmes’s missing informant?

### Red Herrings
- Agnes Vellum’s theatrics (profitable illusion masking real information).  
- Tobias Greel’s morbid lectures (ghoulish but not murderous).  
- The “man with no face” (mask, not spectre).

### True Clues
- Left‑bias blade grind; coach route; charity tokens; matching watermark between diary and trust pamphlets.

### How Everything Connects
- A charitable trust launders money and clothes; the coach ferries bodies and garments off‑route; the diary’s author lifts sealed details from Yard files via a club patron. The Thirteen may be a cover name for a rota of men sharing a method—one of whom now imitates the Ripper to bury separate crimes. Holmes hunts the organiser; Watson realises the diary is bait tailored to him.

## Game Mechanics

### Available Player Actions
- **Observe/Examine:** Close‑read scenes for layered details; sanity may colour description but clues persist across layers.
- **Interrogate:** Period‑appropriate dialogue with pressure, empathy, or guile approaches.
- **Deduce (with Holmes):** Combine clues on Holmes’s map to test hypotheses; wrong links generate persuasive but brittle theories.
- **Treat/Restrain:** Use medical skills to stabilise NPCs or yourself; affects later cooperation.
- **Manage Vice:** Resist or indulge laudanum; alters perception, unlocks “insight” lines with risk.

### Interaction Possibilities
- Branching dialogues, timed prompts during tense scenes, collaborative deductions at 221B, stealthy observation during midnight deliveries, séance “call and response” mini‑ritual revealing coded speech.

### Progression System
- Chapter‑based with optional side vignettes (workhouse, morgue, docks). Reputation with Yard, underclass, and gentry modifies access. Sanity and Trust (Holmes↔Watson) are tracked and gates certain endings.

### How the Story Unfolds
- **Prologue:** The Diary of Blood (opening scene above).  
- **Act I:** Mapping the City (Yard files, St. Bart’s anomalies, first coach sighting).  
- **Act II:** Parlours & Crypts (séance, charity tokens, missing informant).  
- **Act III:** The River Route (coach to river stairs; confrontation with the Beadle).  
- **Finale:** The Study in Vellum (unmasking at a gentleman’s club; choice to burn or keep the diary, altering epilogue).
